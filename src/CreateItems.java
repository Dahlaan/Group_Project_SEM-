/*I want to create items in my system so that I can sell them in my system.
Each item has an identified (ID), name and a price per unit value.
Once created, the ID of an item cannot change and two items cannot have the same ID.
The creation of items is prompted in the “Items options” menu.
In order to create an item, the user must input: (i) the item ID, (ii) the item name and (iii) the item price.
When the item is created successfully, the system should print the message: "Item <ID> was registered successfully." */
