    //if the return if the specified Item ID was not registered: "Item <ID> was not registered yet."

    //If the specified Item ID exists but has no review yet: "Item <item name> has not been reviewed yet."

    //If the specified index is lower than 1 or greater than the number of reviews for that item (i.e., outside valid range):
    // "Invalid review number. Choose between 1 and <num of item reviews>."


    //Feels like it is alot of if statements like if ranking and notation is empty then return: above
